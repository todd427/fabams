    "blurb": "The son of a miner, Kindan has no expectations for any other life. He loves his lessons with the camp\u2019s harper, but music isn\u2019t part of a miner\u2019s future. He also enjoys helping out with the camp\u2019s watch-wher\u2014 a creature distantly related to dragons and uniquely suited to work in dark, cold spaces\u2014but even that important job can\u2019t promise a future above the ground. Then disaster strikes. In one terrible instant, Kindan loses his family and the camp loses its watch-wher. It will take a new friendship and a new responsibility to teach Kindan that even a seemingly impossible dream is never out of reach . . . and that light can be found in the deepest darkness.",
